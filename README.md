		<dd>corewar is a project of 2 main part:<dd>
		- <b>First the asm</b> : A program that compile champions in assembly language, and generate a binary programs that can be interpreted by the virtual machine.<dd>
		- <b>Second the is the virtual machine</b> : It will house the binary programs (the champions) and provide them with a standard execution environment, It offers a lot of features useful to the fight.<dd>
